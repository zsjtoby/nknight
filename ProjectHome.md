I am sure you guys know what RBAC is, however, in case if you have forgot...Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of giving access to a computer application resources based on the roles of individual users or groups. In this context, access to a resource is the ability of an individual user to perform a specific task, such as view, create, delete or modify. Roles are defined according to authority and responsibility of the user.
